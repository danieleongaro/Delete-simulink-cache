# Delete simulink cache
A simple batch script to delete .slxc files and slprj folders.
## How to use
Place it in a folder and double click it. It will delete all files .slxc and folders slprj in the root directory and in the subfolders of the root directory.

You can also run it in a terminal with `./delete_cache`. In some cases it will throw some errors but it will still delete the files and folders.

This works only on Windows.

## Examples
The folders "Test 1" and "Test 1 - Copy" are the examples: "Test 1" is the original folder structure and "Test 1 - Copy" is the folder after the script did its job.
